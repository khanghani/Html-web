       <img src="Body-2-7-1024x640.jpg" alt="Minar-e-Pakistan" width="300" height="300">

       <p><b>Minar-e-Pakistan</b> (  literally "Tower of Pakistan") is a tower located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution (which was later called the Pakistan Resolution) on 23 March 1940 - the first official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to the creation of Pakistan in 1947.</p>
   <p><b>Design:</b>The tower reflects a blend of Mughal/Islamic and modern architecture.

    The tower was designed and supervised by, Nasreddin Murat-Khan, a Russian-born Pakistani architect and civil engineer. The minaret provides a panoramic view to visitors who can access the top by climbing up the stairs or by means of an elevator.
    
    The tower base is shaped like a flower. The area surrounding the monument is covered with parks and flowers. The location is often used for political and religious events. It is also known as the "Liberty Tower of Pakistan</p>

<p>The <b>Faisal Mosque</b> (romanized: faisal masjid) is the national mosque of Pakistan, located in the capital city, Islamabad. It is the fifth-largest mosque in the world and the largest within South Asia, located on the foothills of Margalla Hills in Islamabad. It is named after the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The mosque features a contemporary design consisting of eight sides of concrete shell and is inspired by the design of a typical Bedouin tent.

    A major tourist attraction in Pakistan, the mosque is a contemporary and influential piece of Islamic architecture.
    
    Construction of the mosque began in 1976 after a $28 million grant from Saudi King Faisal, whose name the mosque bears. The unconventional design by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay was selected after an international competition. Without a typical dome, the mosque is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded by four 260 feet (79 m) tall minarets. The design features eight-sided shell shaped sloping roofs forming a triangular worship hall which can hold 10,000 worshippers.</p>

    <h1>Fort Bala Hissar</h1>
    <img src="fort.webp" alt="Bala Hissar" width="300" height="300">
    <p><b>Bala Hissar</b>  also spelt Bala Hisar, is a historic fortress located in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. First mentioned by 7th-century explorer Xuanzang, the fort was used as a royal residence for the Durrani Empire since 1747, when the Afghan king, Ahmad Shah Durrani, conquered Peshawar. The Marathas briefly occupied it after capturing Peshawar in 1758 but it was soon retaken by the Afghans. The Sikhs destroyed and reconstructed the fort after capturing Peshawar in March 1823. In 1849, the British East India Company reconstructed the fort's outer walls.

        The fort now serves as headquarters for Pakistan's Frontier Corps.</p>
        <p><b>Design:</b>The fort stands on a high mound in the northwestern corner of Peshawar City. Not long ago, the fort used to be conspicuously away from the old city of Peshawar, but now the construction of new buildings has covered space between the old city and the fort. However, the fort's position on a high mound gives a commanding and panoramic view of Peshawar and the entire Peshawar valley.</p>

    <img src="fort.webp" alt="Lahore Fort" width="300" height="300">
    <p><b>The Lahore Fort</b>  is a citadel in the city of Lahore in Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of Walled city of Lahore and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares (49 acres). It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendor and opulence.[4]

        Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia, the first record of a fortified structure at the site was regarding an 11th-century mudbrick fort. The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of <b>Emperor Akbar</b>, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs. Additions from the <b>Shah Jahan</b> period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs, while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal emperors, <b>Aurangzeb</b>, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque.</p>
